FIRST EPIC

1. create board of 10 by 10 grid

Hint: Use a for loop to append to a table a <tr> tag, within that loop create another for loop to create the <td> tags. For a recap on loops look at Learn Day "Javascript Arrays and Iteration".
Hint: Each loop will count to 10.
Hint: Each <td> needs to have an id.

2. when user clicks a position, position changes color (showing it's been torpedoed)

Hint: document.getElementById("myDiv").className = "hit" to set the class of an element called "myDiv"

3. create a counter to track how many torpedoes used

4. once a position has been torpedoed, can't be torpedoed again

5. have 5 single length ships displayed on the board (user's ships)

Hint: Create a global variable called board and have it hold an empty array. Have that empty array hold 10 empty arrays, creating a 2d array.
Hint: Create a global constant SHIP variable with a value of 1.
Hint: Create a loop that accesses the board at a random row and column and places a SHIP.


6. when clicking on a position, change color (or other way of noting) to show a ship was located there and has been hit (and hit count goes up hell yeah)

Hint: Create a .onclick function to check the board for the presence of a SHIP.
If nothing is there it is a MISS.
If a SHIP is there, it will be a HIT.

7. winning condition: 5 hits on the board. Notify user when game is won and over

8. Limit of 25 torpedoes. When torpedoes run out, game over

9. As a user if I lose, I can see where the ships were, so that I know there were actual ships on the board.

Hint: Use a document.getElementById("myDiv").className to modify the existing sections.


for (var row=1; row<=10; row++){
  var attempt1row = document.createElement("TR")
  attempt1row.id ="rowId"
  document.getElementById("container").appendChild(attempt1row)
    for (var col=1; col<=10; col++){
      var attempt1col = document.createElement("TD")
      document.getElementById("rowId").appendChild(attempt1col)
  }
}
